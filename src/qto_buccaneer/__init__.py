QTO Buccaneer - Quantity Takeoff tools for data-savvy BIM rebels.

A Python-powered toolkit for exploring, extracting, and calculating quantities from IFC models.
Built for architects, engineers, and construction pros who know their way around Excel more than Python.

### Main Features

- Calculate project-wide metrics based on your own definitions
- Calculate metrics per room or space
- Benchmark different projects to spot trends and outliers
- Export results to Excel and other report formats used by your team
- Create beautiful reports with plans, making information visible and manageable
- Define metric logic using a user-friendly YAML config file â€” no need to write code
- Enrich and clean up IFC files more easily than working directly with raw ifcopenshell
- Repair IFC Models based on rules
- Build up project specific workflows and apply the same rules consecutive to the models

### Package Structure

- metrics: Core metrics calculation functionality
- enrich: IFC model enrichment and data cleaning
- reports: Export and reporting utilities
- plots: Visualization and plotting tools
- utils: Helper functions for IFC handling and quantity calculations
- configs: Configuration files and settings
- repairs: IFC model repair functionality

### Designed for IFC, Optimized for abstractBIM Data

This library works with any well-structured IFC file, but it shines brightest when used with clean, consistent data.
The toolkit is optimized for abstractBIM Data in the presets, providing:

- Consistent naming
- Predictable geometry
- Clean data structure

Which means less time debugging, more time automating.

While you can use raw IFC + ifcopenshell, the toolkit includes helpers and examples to ease the pain
of working with less structured models.

### Quick Start

```python
from qto_buccaneer.metrics import calculate_all_metrics
import yaml

# Load config
with open("path/to/metrics_config.yaml", "r") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Calculate metrics
metrics_df = calculate_all_metrics(
    config=config,
    ifc_path="path/to/your/model.ifc"
)
```
