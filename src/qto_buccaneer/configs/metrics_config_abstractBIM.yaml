# Configuration for project metrics.

# Each metric is defined as a dictionary with the following keys:
# - description: A short description of the metric.
# - quantity_type: The type of quantity to calculate. Options include:
#     - "area"
#     - "volume"
#     - "count"
# - ifc_entity: The IFC entity to calculate the quantity for (e.g. IfcWall, IfcSlab).
# - pset_name: The name of the Property Set (Pset) to retrieve the property from.
# - prop_name: The name of the property or attribute within the Pset (Property Set) to use for quantity calculation.
# - include_filter: A dictionary of conditions to include only specific elements.
# - include_filter_logic: Logical operator to combine multiple include filters. Options:
#     - "AND"
#     - "OR"
# - subtract_filter: A dictionary of conditions to subtract specific elements from the result.
# - subtract_filter_logic: Logical operator to combine multiple subtract filters. Options:
#     - "AND"
#     - "OR"

# ---------------------------
# Filter Key Usage Examples:
# ---------------------------

# Use filters to narrow down the included or subtracted elements. Examples:

# 1. Key-value pair:
#    - description: "Calculate area of internal walls"
#    - include_filter: PredefinedType: "INTERNAL"

# 2. Filter with multiple values:
#    - subtract_filter: Name: ["LUF", "Void"]

# 3. Filter with boolean value:
#    - subtract_filter: Pset_CoveringCommon.IsExternal: true

# 4. Filter with condition (operator, value):
#    - subtract_filter: Thickness: ("<", 0.1)

# Combine multiple conditions using include_filter_logic or subtract_filter_logic:
# Example:
#     include_filter: PredefinedType: "INTERNAL", Pset_SpaceCommon.IsExternal: true
#     include_filter_logic: "AND"

# adding new metrics and template:
# 1. add a new metric to the metrics list by copying this template:
# metrics:
#   new_metric:
#     description: "Description of the metric"
#     quantity_type: "area" or "volume" or "count"
#     ifc_entity: "IfcSpace"
#     pset_name: "Pset_Name" (leave blank for attributes)
#     prop_name: "Attribute Name or Property Name"
#     include_filter:
#       "Key": "Value"
#       "Key": ["Value1", "Value2"]
#       ...
#     include_filter_logic: "AND" or "OR"
#     subtract_filter:
#       "Key": ["<"", Number]
#       "Key": ["Value1", "Value2"]
#       ...
#     subtract_filter_logic: "OR"

# Explain the difference between metrics and room-based metrics:
# - metrics: Calculated based on all spaces or elements in the project.
# - room-based metrics: Calculated based on spaces grouped by room.

# TODO: include or exclude Filter merged to one, and with NOR added -> flatter hirachy
# TODO: . as seperator can lead to problems in Pset.Attribut
# TODO: use the IfcOpenshell logic for filtering => more felxibility and more stabel (https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/ifcopenshell-python/selector_syntax.html)
