ü§ù Contributing

Ahoy fellow BIM pirates! We're excited about every form of contribution, whether it's:

- Ideas for new features
- Bug reports
- Code contributions
- Use cases we haven't thought of
- Or anything else you think could make this better

At this stage, the project is intentionally pragmatic and fast-moving. There's no heavy process‚Äîjust clean, modular code and a shared goal: making quantity takeoffs smarter and more usable for real workflows.
Where it's headed

As the community grows, I plan to introduce:

- A formal contribution guide (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Unit and integration testing (pytest)
- GitHub Actions for automated CI
- Issue templates and feature request workflows
- A plugin-friendly architecture for extensions and custom logic

Until then, feel free to fork, clone, and raise a PR‚Äîor just email me your thoughts. I‚Äôm deeply involved in model-based workflows, and I know the real pain points we‚Äôre solving for. Let's build better quantity takeoff tools together.
