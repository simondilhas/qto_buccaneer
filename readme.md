## ‚öì What This Is

‚öì What This Is

A general-purpose Python library for calculating and managing quantity takeoffs from IFC models using open standards and open-source tools.

With this toolkit, you can:

    Define metric logic using a YAML config file

    Enrich and clean up IFC files‚Äîfriendlier than raw ifcopenshell

    Calculate project-wide metrics based on your definitions

    Calculate metrics per room or space

    Export results to Excel and other report formats

## üß≠ Designed for abstractBIM Data

This library works with any well-structured IFC file, but it shines brightest when used with clean, consistent data.
And that's why it's optimized for abstractBIM Data in the presets. 

Because abstractBIM gives you:

    Consistent naming

    Predictable geometry

    Clean data structure

Which means less time debugging, more time automating.

    Think of abstractBIM as your treasure map.
    The calculations here are free‚Äîthe clean data is the real loot.

Yes, you can still use raw IFC + ifcopenshell, but you‚Äôll want to be comfortable with model quirks. We will added some helpers and examples to ease the pain...




> Want to skip the modeling chaos and get right to the treasure?  
> Use abstractBIM as your map. The calculations here are free‚Äîthe clean data is the magic sauce.

git clone https://github.com/simondilhas/qto-buccaneer.git
cd qto-buccaneer
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/simondilhas/qto-buccaneer.git
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/simondilhas/qto-buccaneer.git
cd qto-buccaneer
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: Install directly from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/simondilhas/qto-buccaneer.git
```

### Usage Examples

Look bellow or in the folder /examples for more detailed once.

#### Calculate Metrics
```python
from qto_buccaneer.metrics import calculate_all_metrics
import yaml

def main():
    # Load config
    with open("path/to/metrics_config.yaml", "r") as f:
        config = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    metrics_df = calculate_all_metrics(
        config=config,
        filepath="path/to/your/model.ifc"
    )
    
    # Save results
    metrics_df.to_excel("results.xlsx")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Enrich IFC Model
```python
import pandas as pd
from qto_buccaneer.enrich import enrich_ifc_with_df

def main():
    # Load enrichment data
    df_enrichment = pd.read_excel("path/to/enrichment_data.xlsx")
    
    # Enrich IFC file
    enriched_ifc_path = enrich_ifc_with_df(
        ifc_file="path/to/your/model.ifc",
        df_for_ifc_enrichment=df_enrichment,
        key="LongName",  # column name to match IFC elements
        pset_name="Pset_Enrichment"  # optional
    )
    
    print(f"Created enriched IFC file: {enriched_ifc_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

#### Configuration Files

The package uses YAML configuration files to define metrics and enrichment rules. Here's an example metrics configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  gross_floor_area:
    description: "The gross floor area excluding voids"
    quantity_type: "area"
    ifc_entity: "IfcSpace"
    pset_name: "Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities"
    prop_name: "NetFloorArea"
    include_filter:
      Name: "GrossArea"
    subtract_filter:
      Name: ["LUF", "Void", "Luftraum"]

room_based_metrics:
  windows_area_by_room:
    description: "Get windows grouped by room"
    ifc_entity: "IfcWindow"
    grouping_attribute: "GlobalId"
    pset_name: "Qto_WindowBaseQuantities"
    prop_name: "Area"
```

Key configuration concepts:
- `metrics`: Standard metrics that return a single value for the entire project
- `room_based_metrics`: Metrics calculated per room/space
- Filters can use:
  - Simple key-value pairs: `Name: "GrossArea"`
  - Lists: `Name: ["LUF", "Void"]`
  - Comparisons: `Width: [">", 0.15]`
  - Boolean values: `IsExternal: true`

For more examples and detailed configuration options, check the `configs/` directory in the repository.
