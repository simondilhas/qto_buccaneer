        "# ⚓ Quantity Takeoff Meets Data Science Quick Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "A few years ago, I was working for a design-build company, constantly chasing models that were never quite \"right.\" Sound familiar? I’d get geometry with no data, data with no structure, and data full with inconsitencies e.g, gypsum bord walls as subteran exterior walls.  \n",
        "\n",
        "That frustration? It sparked a journey — a journey into the world of data science. Into creating abstractBIM.\n",
        "\n",
        "And now, I'm bringing that journey to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧭 Why This Introductory?\n",
        "\n",
        "This isn’t your typical quantity takeoff approach of redrawing models or tracing dusty PDFs. This is where old-school construction know-how shakes hands with new-school data smarts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this quick tutorial, we’ll explore how to blend traditional quantity surveying with data science tools to work smarter, not harder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let’s address the elephant in the server room: code fear.\n",
        "Many quantity surveyors are absolute Excel wizards — pivot tables, nested formulas, conditional formatting sorcery — but the moment someone mentions Python, panic sets in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the truth: that Excel brain of yours? It’s already 80% of the way there.\n",
        "The last 20%? That’s just a bit of guidance, a compass to navigate the syntax seas — and that’s exactly what this intro is for.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this, you’ll see that data science isn't some far-off land for Silicon Valley types — it's a natural extension of what you already do. We’re just swapping the red pen for a script that actually listens.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💡 What *Is* Data Science, Anyway?\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, data science is about turning information into insight.  \n",
        "You already work with data — drawings, models, specs, past projects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Data science just adds some superpowers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Spot patterns and trends humans miss  \n",
        "- Automate the boring stuff  \n",
        "- Make better decisions, backed by real evidence  \n",
        "\n",
        "So yeah, it's kind of what you’re already doing — just with fewer rulers and more Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ⚙️ Why Mix Quantity Surveying with Data Science?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the combo is lethal (in a good way):\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🎯 **More Accuracy**: Fewer mistakes, tighter estimates  \n",
        "- ⏱ **More Time**: Automate the grunt work  \n",
        "- 🧠 **Smarter Decisions**: Get insights you can actually use  \n",
        "- 🗣 **Better Collaboration**: Clear, shareable, data-backed narratives  \n",
        "- 🚀 **Career Boost**: Stay sharp in a rapidly changing industry  \n",
        "- 🔄 **Cross-Pollination**: Steal — ahem, *learn* — from other industries  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Kind of Data Are We Working With?\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s be clear: this tutorial assumes you’re starting with some level of structured data. That means not just a scanned PDF or a hand-measured napkin sketch.\n",
        "\n",
        "But don’t worry — even if you’re working off a PDF, you can still get into the game. If you export your measurements into a structured Excel sheet (like: room names, wall lengths, window counts…), you’re already halfway into the workflow.\n",
        "🧹 The Cleanup Phase (a.k.a. Pirate Chores)\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on real-world experience, you’ll spend a good chunk of time cleaning up messy model data.\n",
        "We’re talking about:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inconsistent naming\n",
        "\n",
        "- Elements in the wrong categories\n",
        "\n",
        "- Geometry that looks good but has no meaning under the hood\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s exactly why we created the abstractBIM approach — a way to strip things down to what actually matters for quantity takeoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Is abstractBIM?\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as a minimal, structured representation of a model — just the bones you need for calculating quantities and running workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "With just:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Spaces\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optionaly IfcWindows and/or IfcDoors\n",
        "\n",
        "We can rebuild a new models with walls, slabs and coverings, just based on this minimal input.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The result?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Structured, consistent data — ready for automated workflows, smart takeoffs, and fast iteration.\n",
